# Elevator

**Introduction**

In this repository you can find everything needed to create an Arduino based elevator. This was project 1 of Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam.

**Features**

- When a button on a story is pressed, the cage will move to that story
- Once the story is reached, music will be played
- The current location of the cage is displayed on every story
- When the cage passes a story, a green LED will turn on
- On top of the elevator is a keypad with which we can send the cage to any story we want
